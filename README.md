# Leveraging Data Science to Advance Equity

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook demo and the code for the Leveraging Data Science to Advance Equity project presented at the [Museum Next Digital Collections Summit 2024](https://www.museumnext.com/events/digital-collections-summit/schedule/).

Racism has been deeply embedded in museums since their inception, as they acquired collections through colonial activities that oppressed indigenous peoples. Minority communities saw little representation in museums, while their artifacts were displayed without context.

Recent movements have pressured museums to confront their racist legacies. However, behind the scenes museum databases still rely on colonial terms assigned by early white collectors that promoted harmful stereotypes.

This presentation examines using data science to systematically uncover and replace derogatory language in a botanical collection database of over 1 million specimens.

The goal is provide a means to purge museumsâ€™ digital archives of racist ideologies that have inhibited diversity.
